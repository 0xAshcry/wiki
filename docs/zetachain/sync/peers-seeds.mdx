# Live Peers / Seeds

> When you start a node, you often need to connect to the network. This requires you to connect to one or more peers to start downloading the blockchain and receiving new blocks and transactions. Seeding nodes or bootstrap nodes help in this initial connection process.

#### List of active peers:
```bash
123
```

:::info
You can add them manually to your `config.toml` or run the commands below.
:::
```bash
# create variable PEERS
PEERS="123"

# add peers to config.toml
sed -i 's|^persistent_peers *=.*|persistent_peers = "'$PEERS'"|' $HOME/.zetacored/config/config.toml

# restart the node
sudo systemctl restart zetacored
```

import LivePeers from '@site/src/components/LivePeers';
<LivePeers />
