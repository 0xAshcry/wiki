export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

# Live Peers / Seeds

> When you start a node, you often need to connect to the network. This requires you to connect to one or more peers to start downloading the blockchain and receiving new blocks and transactions. Seeding nodes or bootstrap nodes help in this initial connection process.

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.
